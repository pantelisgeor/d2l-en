    "# Linear Algebra\n",
    "\n",
    "By now, we can load datasets into tensors and manipulate these tensors with basic mathematical operations. To start building sophisticated models, we will also need a few tools from linear algebra. This section offers a gentle introduction to the most essential concepts, starting from scalar arithmetic and ramping up to matrix multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scalars\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Most everyday mathematics consists of manipulating numbers one at a time. Formally, we call these values *scalars*. For example, the temperature in Palo Alto is a balmy $72$ degrees Fahrenheit. If you wanted to convert the temperature to Celsius you would evaluate the expression $c = \\frac{5}{9}(f - 32)$, setting $f$ to $72$. In this equation, the values $5$, $9$, and $32$ are scalars. The variables $c$ and $f$ represent unknown scalars.\n",
    "\n",
    "We denote scalars by ordinary lower-cased letters (e.g., $x$, $y$, and $z$) and the space of all (continuous) *real-valued* scalars by $\\mathbb{R}$. For expedience, we will skip past rigorous definitions of *spaces*. Just remember that the expression $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is a formal way to say that $x$ is a real-valued scalar. The symbol $\\in$ (pronounced \"in\") denotes membership in a set. For example, $x, y \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ indicates that $x$ and $y$ are variables that can only take values $0$ or $1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scalars are implemented as tensors that contain only one element.** Below, we assign two scalars and perform the familiar addition, multiplication, division, and exponentiation operations."

    "When vectors represent examples from real-world datasets, their values hold some real-world significance. For example, if we were training a model to predict the risk of a loan defaulting, we might associate each applicant with a vector whose components correspond to quantities like their income, length of employment, or number of previous defaults.\n",

    "Vectors are implemented as $1^{\\mathrm{st}}$-order tensors. In general, such tensors can have arbitrary lengths,\n",

    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we reviewed all the linear algebra\n",
    "that you will need to understand\n",
    "a remarkable chunk of modern deep learning.\n",
    "There is a lot more to linear algebra\n",
    "and much of it is useful for machine learning.\n",
    "For example, matrices can be decomposed into factors,\n",
    "and these decompositions can reveal\n",
    "low-dimensional structure in real-world datasets.\n",
    "There are entire subfields of machine learning\n",
    "that focus on using matrix decompositions\n",
    "and their generalizations to high-order tensors\n",
    "to discover structure in datasets \n",
    "and solve prediction problems.\n",
    "But this book focuses on deep learning.\n",
    "And we believe you will be more inclined \n",
    "to learn more mathematics\n",
    "once you have gotten your hands dirty\n",
    "applying machine learning to real datasets.\n",
    "So while we reserve the right \n",
    "to introduce more mathematics later on,\n",
    "we wrap up this section here.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are eager to learn more linear algebra,\n",
    "there are many excellent books and online resources.\n",
    "For a more advanced crash course, consider checking out\n",
    ":cite:`Strang.1993,Kolter.2008,Petersen.Pedersen.ea.2008`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To recap:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Scalars, vectors, matrices, and tensors are \n",
    "  the basic mathematical objects used in linear algebra \n",
    "  and have zero, one, two, and an arbitrary number of axes, respectively.\n",
    "* Tensors can be sliced or reduced along specified axes \n",
    "  via indexing, or operations such as `sum` and `mean`, respectively.\n",
    "* Elementwise products are called Hadamard products. \n",
    "  By contrast, dot products, matrix-vector products, and matrix-matrix products \n",
    "  are not elementwise operations and in general return objects \n",
    "  that have different shapes than the operands. \n",
    "* Compared to Hadamard products, matrix-matrix products \n",
    "  take considerably longer to compute (cubic rather than quadratic time).\n",
    "* Norms capture various notions of the magnitude of a vector, \n",
    "  and are commonly applied to the difference of two vectors \n",
    "  to measure their distance.\n",
    " * Common vector norms include the $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ norms, \n",
    "   and common matrix norms include the *spectral* and *Frobenius* norms.\n",

    "1. Prove that the transpose of the transpose of a matrix is the matrix itself: $(\\mathbf{A}^\\top)^\\top = \\mathbf{A}$.\n",
    "1. Given two matrices $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$, show that sum and transposition commute: $\\mathbf{A}^\\top + \\mathbf{B}^\\top = (\\mathbf{A} + \\mathbf{B})^\\top$.\n",
    "1. Given any square matrix $\\mathbf{A}$, is $\\mathbf{A} + \\mathbf{A}^\\top$ always symmetric? Can you prove the result by using only the result of the previous two exercises?\n",
    "1. We defined the tensor `X` of shape (2, 3, 4) in this section. What is the output of `len(X)`? Write your answer without implementing any code, then check your answer using code. \n",
    "1. For a tensor `X` of arbitrary shape, does `len(X)` always correspond to the length of a certain axis of `X`? What is that axis?\n",
    "1. Run `A / A.sum(axis=1)` and see what happens. Can you analyze the reason?\n",
    "1. When traveling between two points in downtown Manhattan, what is the distance that you need to cover in terms of the coordinates, i.e., in terms of avenues and streets? Can you travel diagonally?\n",
    "1. Consider a tensor with shape (2, 3, 4). What are the shapes of the summation outputs along axis 0, 1, and 2?\n",
    "1. Feed a tensor with 3 or more axes to the `linalg.norm` function and observe its output. What does this function compute for tensors of arbitrary shape?\n",
    "1. Define three large matrices, say $\\mathbf{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2^{10} \\times 2^{16}}$, $\\mathbf{B} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2^{16} \\times 2^{5}}$ and $\\mathbf{C} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2^{5} \\times 2^{14}}$, for instance initialized with Gaussian random variables. You want to compute the product $\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B} \\mathbf{C}$. Is there any difference in memory footprint and speed, depending on whether you compute $(\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) \\mathbf{C}$ or $\\mathbf{A} (\\mathbf{B} \\mathbf{C})$. Why?\n",
