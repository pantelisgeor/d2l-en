    "We now have all the ingredients required to assemble\n",
    "a fully-functional CNN.\n",
    "In our earlier encounter with image data, we applied\n",
    "a linear model with softmax regression (:numref:`sec_softmax_scratch`)\n",
    "and an MLP (:numref:`sec_mlp-implementation`)\n",
    "to pictures of clothing in the Fashion-MNIST dataset.\n",
    "To make such data amenable we first flattened each image from a $28\\times28$ matrix\n",
    "into a fixed-length $784$-dimensional vector,\n",
    "and thereafter processed them in fully connected layers.\n",
    "Now that we have a handle on convolutional layers,\n",
    "we can retain the spatial structure in our images.\n",
    "As an additional benefit of replacing fully connected layers with convolutional layers,\n",
    "we will enjoy more parsimonious models that require far fewer parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will introduce *LeNet*,\n",
    "among the first published CNNs\n",
    "to capture wide attention for its performance on computer vision tasks.\n",
    "The model was introduced by (and named for) Yann LeCun,\n",
    "then a researcher at AT&T Bell Labs,\n",
    "for the purpose of recognizing handwritten digits in images :cite:`LeCun.Bottou.Bengio.ea.1998`.\n",
    "This work represented the culmination\n",
    "of a decade of research developing the technology.\n",
    "In 1989, LeCun's team published the first study to successfully\n",
    "train CNNs via backpropagation :cite:`LeCun.Boser.Denker.ea.1989`.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time LeNet achieved outstanding results\n",

    ":label:`img_lenet`\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic units in each convolutional block\n",
    "are a convolutional layer, a sigmoid activation function,\n",
    "and a subsequent average pooling operation.\n",
    "Note that while ReLUs and max-pooling work better,\n",
    "these discoveries had not yet been made at the time.\n",
    "Each convolutional layer uses a $5\\times 5$ kernel\n",
    "and a sigmoid activation function.\n",
    "These layers map spatially arranged inputs\n",
    "to a number of two-dimensional feature maps, typically\n",
    "increasing the number of channels.\n",
    "The first convolutional layer has 6 output channels,\n",
    "while the second has 16.\n",
    "Each $2\\times2$ pooling operation (stride 2)\n",
    "reduces dimensionality by a factor of $4$ via spatial downsampling.\n",
    "The convolutional block emits an output with shape given by\n",
    "(batch size, number of channel, height, width).\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to pass output from the convolutional block\n",
    "to the dense block,\n",
    "we must flatten each example in the minibatch.\n",
    "In other words, we take this four-dimensional input and transform it\n",
    "into the two-dimensional input expected by fully connected layers:\n",
    "as a reminder, the two-dimensional representation that we desire uses the first dimension to index examples in the minibatch\n",
    "and the second to give the flat vector representation of each example.\n",
    "LeNet's dense block has three fully connected layers,\n",
    "with 120, 84, and 10 outputs, respectively.\n",
    "Because we are still performing classification,\n",
    "the 10-dimensional output layer corresponds\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we made significant progress. We moved from the MLPs of the 1980s to the CNNs of the 1990s and early 2000s. The architectures proposed, e.g., in the form of LeNet-5 remain meaningful, even to this day. It is worth comparing the error rates on Fashion-MNIST achievable with LeNet-5 both to the very best possible with MLPs (:numref:`sec_mlp-implementation`) and those with significantly more advanced architectures such as ResNet (:numref:`sec_resnet`). LeNet is much more similar to the latter than to the former. One of the primary differences, as we shall see, is that greater amounts of computation afforded significantly more complex architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second difference is the relative ease with which we were able to implement LeNet. What used to be an engineering challenge worth months of C++ and assembly code, engineering to improve SN, an early Lisp based deep learning tool :cite:`Bottou.Le-Cun.1988`, and finally experimentation with models can now be accomplished in minutes. It is this incredible productivity boost that has democratized deep learning model development tremendously. In the next chapter we will follow down this rabbit to hole to see where it takes us.\n",

    "## Exercises\n",

    "1. Let's modernize LeNet. Implement and test the following changes:\n",
    "    1. Replace the average pooling with max-pooling.\n",
    "    1. Replace the softmax layer with ReLU.\n",
    "1. Try to change the size of the LeNet style network to improve its accuracy in addition to max-pooling and ReLU.\n",

    "    1. Adjust the learning rates and other training details (e.g., initialization and number of epochs.)\n",
    "1. Try out the improved network on the original MNIST dataset.\n",
    "1. Display the activations of the first and second layer of LeNet for different inputs (e.g., sweaters and coats).\n",
    "1. What happens to the activations when you feed significantly different images into the network (e.g., cats, cars, or even random noise)?\n",
